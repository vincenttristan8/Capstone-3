Saudi Arabia Used Cars Price Prediction Model
Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning model aimed at predicting the prices of used cars in Saudi Arabia. In the rapidly evolving automotive market of Saudi Arabia, determining the fair price for used cars is crucial for both buyers and sellers to ensure clarity and trust in transactions. However, pricing used cars can often be a complex challenge involving various variables such as region, car type, and specifications. To address this complexity, we propose the use of machine learning models to provide effective solutions.

Problem Statement
The main challenge is the uncertainty in setting reasonable prices, which can lead to overpricing and underpricing. Overpricing may result in decreased buyer interest and financial loss for the seller, while underpricing can lead to financial losses for the seller and dissatisfaction for the buyer due to low resale value. With the diversity of car attributes such as type, location, manufacturer, transmission, additional options, year of manufacture, engine size, and mileage, determining the correct resale value becomes complicated.

Goals
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the prices of used cars in Saudi Arabia based on various attributes, with a focus on avoiding overpricing and underpricing. This model is expected to provide realistic and transparent values, benefiting both sellers who want to maximize their sales and buyers looking for fair deals. By successfully achieving this goal, this project will help create stability and trust in the automotive market, providing benefits to all stakeholders involved in the process of buying and selling used cars in Saudi Arabia.

Analytic Approach
The analytical approach for this project will begin with data exploration and cleaning, including handling missing or incomplete data and converting categorical variables into formats that can be processed by machine learning models. This will be followed by exploratory analysis to understand the relationships between attributes and detect important patterns in the data. Relevant feature selection and training of machine learning models, such as linear regression or others, will then be conducted.

Repository Structure
data: Contains datasets used for training and testing the machine learning model.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Conclusion
By developing and deploying this machine learning model, we aim to provide a valuable tool for stakeholders in the automotive market of Saudi Arabia. With accurate predictions of used car prices, we hope to foster transparency, trust, and fair transactions, ultimately benefiting both buyers and sellers. We invite contributions, feedback, and collaboration to improve and expand this project for the benefit of the community.
